# Dynamic Engineering Squad – Project Ideas

## Dynamic Itinerary

### Problem
A user wants to create a vacation itinerary, but the weather changes rapidly, foot traffic increases or decreases, or hotel availability changes days before the vacation, causing major disruptions to their plans.

### Solution
In this application, users would:
- Create an account
- Create a new itinerary
- Select a worldwide location to visit
- Choose a length of stay
- Select preferences such as likes and dislikes

An external AI—using **Google’s Gemini API** or **OpenAI’s API**—would generate a personalized itinerary based on the user’s preferences and trip duration.

The itinerary is **dynamic** and automatically updates based on:
- Weather conditions
- Foot or vehicle traffic
- Hotel availability

**Optional Add-ons**
- Force specific locations (e.g., museums, theaters) into the itinerary
- Purchase tickets for events directly through the platform

## Study Aid / Assistant

### Problem
Students often use AI to complete homework for them rather than using it as a tool to support studying and learning.

### Solution
In this application, users would:
- Create an account
- Enter or select a topic they are studying
- Choose a type of study material:
  - Flash cards
  - Quizzes
  - Study sheets
  - Other learning aids

An external AI—using **Google’s Gemini API** or **OpenAI’s API**—would generate study materials designed to promote learning instead of replacing it.

**Optional Add-ons**
- Integration with a payment API to enable a **“Pro” mode** with advanced features

## Project Manager

### Problem
Current project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello) are often confusing and unintuitive for users.

### Solution
In this application, users would:
- Create an account
- Create a project board
- Organize work hierarchically:
  - Epics
  - Stories
  - Tasks
  - Subtasks

An external AI—using **Google’s Gemini API** or **OpenAI’s API**—would assist by:
- Automatically generating tasks for stories
- Generating subtasks for tasks

**Optional Add-ons**
- Import existing projects or tasks using the **Jira API**
