# Infrastructure App Idea
## Key Questions
### What is it?
- The application is a way for users to spot infrastructure issues around their town, and submit those issues to be posted online.
- The submission process is gamified - that is, submitting new infrastructure is worth points for the user, verifying/"upvoting" that infrastructure issues exist gives a small point amount, and so on, which contributes to an overall leaderboard of local users. When an infrastructure issue reaches a certain 'upvote' count, users can submit and vote on names for the issue (Such as naming a pothole on Lancaster Dr. "The Lancaster Black Hole"). This leads to a sort of public accountability of the municipality to fix issues. Possibly integrate OpenAI or Gemini API to monitor user submitted names and disallow inappropriate names, or hardcode a list of disallowed words.
- Google Vision or other AI vision APIs can be used to identify the severity of the issue (How large and/or deep a crack is, for example) and material it's made of, and use them to calculate an estimated cost of repair. This would be added to a city's overall "score" - for example, "The City of Salem has $2.4 million in ignored repairs." 
### What is the purpose?
- The purpose of the app is to motivate the local community into finding and documenting infastructure issues within their local municipality. By involving more citizens, civic servants can better see which issues are plaguing the community the most, and the community can see just how important maintaining local infrastructure is.
### Why are you proposing this topic?
- Municipal infrastructure is decaying faster than maintenance budgets are growing. Cities operate on a 'reactive' model—they only fix what is reported. Current reporting tools (311) are bureaucratic and opaque. By gamifying the process, we turn passive residents into active infrastructure monitors, effectively crowdsourcing the city's inspection labor for free By gamifying infrastructure issue identification, we can show the local muncipalities which issues are actually the most pressing to the local community first and foremost.
### Are there any competitors or existing applications that do this? If so, list them and explain why your topic is better or still worth doing.
- Yes. SeeClickFix is the largest competitor currently on the market. Additionally, there are various individual muncipality 311 applications that also do the same thing. The difference between SeeClickFix and our application is that our application promotes more use through the gamification of identifying issues, rather than being dry and unengaging administrative intake forms. This application introduces Identity and Narrative to infrastructure. By allowing the community to name, track, and accrue "bounties" (estimated repair costs) on specific hazards, we transform a maintenance ticket into a community cause. A pothole named "The Tire Shredder" with 500 upvotes and a calculated $4,000 potential vehicle damage risk creates a narrative that standard 311 apps cannot match. This "Social Accountability" engine drives higher engagement and faster municipal response times.

## Vision Statement

- This project is a gamified ASP.NET infrastructure reporting application defined by three core features: AI-driven damage analysis for cost estimation, a competitive community leaderboard, and a unique "naming rights" system that allows users to title and track specific hazards like local landmarks. The purpose of this platform is to transform passive residents into active infrastructure monitors, leveraging social accountability to motivate municipalities to prioritize repairs.  While competitors like SeeClickFix and standard 311 apps exist, they function as dry administrative intake forms; our application improves upon this by introducing identity and narrative—turning a generic ticket into a "community cause" - which drives significantly higher engagement and visibility than existing tools.
