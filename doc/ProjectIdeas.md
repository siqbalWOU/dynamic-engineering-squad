# Dynamic Engineering Squad – Project Ideas

## Dynamic Itinerary

### Problem
A user wants to create a vacation itinerary, but the weather changes rapidly, foot traffic increases or decreases, or hotel availability changes days before the vacation, causing major disruptions to their plans.

### Solution
In this application, users would:
- Create an account
- Create a new itinerary
- Select a worldwide location to visit
- Choose a length of stay
- Select preferences such as likes and dislikes

An external AI—using **Google’s Gemini API** or **OpenAI’s API**—would generate a personalized itinerary based on the user’s preferences and trip duration.

The itinerary is **dynamic** and automatically updates based on:
- Weather conditions
- Foot or vehicle traffic
- Hotel availability

**Optional Add-ons**
- Force specific locations (e.g., museums, theaters) into the itinerary
- Purchase tickets for events directly through the platform

## Study Aid / Assistant

### Problem
Students often use AI to complete homework for them rather than using it as a tool to support studying and learning.

### Solution
In this application, users would:
- Create an account
- Enter or select a topic they are studying
- Choose a type of study material:
  - Flash cards
  - Quizzes
  - Study sheets
  - Other learning aids

An external AI—using **Google’s Gemini API** or **OpenAI’s API**—would generate study materials designed to promote learning instead of replacing it.

**Optional Add-ons**
- Integration with a payment API to enable a **“Pro” mode** with advanced features

## Project Manager

### Problem
Current project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello) are often confusing and unintuitive for users.

### Solution
In this application, users would:
- Create an account
- Create a project board
- Organize work hierarchically:
  - Epics
  - Stories
  - Tasks
  - Subtasks

An external AI—using **Google’s Gemini API** or **OpenAI’s API**—would assist by:
- Automatically generating tasks for stories
- Generating subtasks for tasks

**Optional Add-ons**
- Import existing projects or tasks using the **Jira API**


## Infrastructure Reporting App

### Problem
Current infrastructure reporting tools are bureaucratic and unengagiung, acting as intake forms rather than active community tools.

### Solution
In this application, users would:
- Create an account
- Document local infrastructure issues 
- Engage in a gamified system by ferifying/"upvoting" existing reports to earn points
- Vote on custom anmes for high-visibility issues (E.g. "The Lancaster Black Hole" for a pothole on Lancaster Dr.) to create a narrative and social accountability

An external AI - using **Google's Cloud Vision API** or similar - would assist by:
- Automatically identifying material and possible severity of the damage
- Calculating an estimated "bounty" (repair cost) based on the visual data to display on a public dashboard

### Optional Add-ons
- Interative maps to drop and view pins using the Google Maps API
- Automated email notifications using an email API when specific issues reach a high "upvote" threshold


## Interactive Museum Quest

### Problem
Traditional museum tours are often fail to engage visitors, especially younger audiences or first-time visitors. Visitors miss exhibits that match their interests because they don’t know where to start or what to prioritize.

### Solution
In this application, users would:
- Create an account
- Search for and select a museum or exhibit
- Participate in themed quests tied to exhibits (questions, challenges, scavenger-hunt style tasks)
- Unlock content by completing tasks (answering questions, reaching exhibit checkpoints)
- Track progress during a visit and across multiple visits


An external AI—using **Google’s Gemini API** would assist by:
- Generating exhibit-specific quest challenges and trivia questions
- Providing adaptive hints and summaries based on user progress and exhibit themes


### Optional Add-ons
- QR code scanning at exhibits to verify location/checkpoints
- Scoring, badges, and achievement systems
- Payment integration for premium tours or special exhibits
