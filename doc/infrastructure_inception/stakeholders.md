### User #1: Kyle Glass
- **Age**: 22
- **Occupation**: Delivery Driver
- **Location**: Salem, Oregon
- **Tech Proficiency**: High (Lives on phone, uses navigation/gig apps 8+ hours a day)
- **Background Information**: Kyle is a gig economy worker who spends 40-50 hours a week driving his 2012 Honda Civic around the city delivering food. He knows every shortcut, but more importantly, he knows exactly where every suspension-destroying pothole is located. Last month, he hit a deep pothole on Lancaster Drive that bent his rim and cost him $300 to fix—money he couldn't afford to lose. He feels like the city ignores the roads he drives on daily.
